# Mapstar (Map-A*?)

- OSM data is fetched after determining the boundaries using Overpass Api.
- Each edge between nodes rendered in a Pixi stage.
- Currrently only the BFS(breadth first search) is available
- Needs some improvement/optimization on proccesing the data(Don't enter coordinates that are too far away).
